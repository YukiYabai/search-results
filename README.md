================================

This assignment requires the reproduction of the cosmetic aspects of Google's search results page

What I learned
--------------
- Markdown syntax
- Using position: relative; to move elements around
- Properly nesting links in an unordered list in a navbar to reduce clutter in html
- Using the header, nav, and cite tags to give more semantic meaning to html
- When floating items in a container set the value of the display property of non floated items to "inline" to ensure floated items remain inline
- Attributing styles to the universal indicator in css can cause problems with certain selectors in certain browsers. To avoid problems with inheritance us body instead of *
